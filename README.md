# Image Data Mining: Open CV And Deep Learning
## Goals
The goal for this assignment is to use Open CV and Deep Learning Models, and run Image Data Mining for the following images <br>

## Observations
- For Image 1 (SJSU Project Expo) , we see a significant peak in the blue channel towards the higher end of the intensity values, suggesting a substantial presence of bright blue tones in the image. The red and green channels show a more even distribution across the range of intensity values with smaller peaks, which indicates a variety of these colors present throughout the image.

- In Image 2 (Officers 2019), the red, green, and blue channels all exhibit prominent peaks, with the blue channel showing a particularly sharp peak towards the higher intensity values similar to Image 1. This could be indicative of dominant bright blue elements in the image. All channels show multiple peaks, which is typical for images with a mix of colors and a range of color intensities.
